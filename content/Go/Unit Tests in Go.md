Go ships with the 'testing' package. Example:

```go
:filename: hello_test.go
package hello

import "testing"

func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {
    expected := "Hello, World!"
    if observed := HelloWorld(); observed != expected {
        t.Fatalf("HelloWorld() = %v, want %v", observed, expected)
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE] Test file extension
> Make sure to end your file name with `_test.go`. Read `go help test` for details.

Then run with:

```bash
$ go test
```

Or test a specific package:

```bash
$ go test hello
```

Or using the `-v` flag to also the list of tests descriptors:

```bash
$ go test -v
$ go test -v hello
```

Or to run tests that match a specific description, use `-run <description>`:

```bash
$ go test -v -cover -run 'Triangle'
```

## Test single \_test.go file

Go needs to compile `.go` files that are need for a given test file.
For example, if we try to test `builder_test.go`, depending on how we run the test command, `go` fails to find the pieces of implementation used in the tests.

```bash
$ go test -v ./libhouse/builder_test.go
# command-line-arguments [command-line-arguments.test]
libhouse/builder_test.go:10:14: undefined: getBuilder
libhouse/builder_test.go:18:20: undefined: House
FAIL    command-line-arguments [build failed]
FAIL
```

But we can run tests in the entire `libhouse` package (as other necessary `.go` files will also be processed) and filter specific tests we want with `-run TestName` instead:

```text
$ go test -v ./libhouse -run TestBuilder
=== RUN   TestBuilder
=== RUN   TestBuilder/returns_a_normal_builder
--- PASS: TestBuilder (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestBuilder/returns_a_normal_builder (0.00s)
PASS
ok      main/libhouse   0.002s
```

A similar thing happens with `go run`.
We may get those ‘undefined’ error messages unless we run a command in such a way that `go run` is able to process all the necessary files.

## Subtests (or subcases) leaking state?

Consider testing a counter singleton with a test file like this one:

``` go
package singleton

import "testing"

func TestGetInstance(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("create instance correctly", func(t *testing.T) {
        counter := GetInstance()

        if counter == nil {
            t.Error("Expected Singleton instance, got nil")
        }
    })

    t.Run("always returns he same reference", func(t *testing.T) {
        ref1 := GetInstance()
        ref2 := GetInstance()

        if ref1 != ref2 {
            t.Error("Counters are not the same reference to the same instance")
        }
    })

    t.Run("returns correct value on first call", func(t *testing.T) {
        count := GetInstance().AddOne()

        if count != 1 {
            t.Errorf("Want 1 for first call, got %d", count)
        }
    })

    t.Run("returns correct value on each subsequent call", func(t *testing.T) {
        counter := GetInstance()

        _ = counter.AddOne()
        valueForCall2 := counter.AddOne()

        if valueForCall2 != 2 {
            t.Errorf("Want 2 for second call, got %d", valueForCall2)
        }
    })
}
```

Basically, `GetInstance()` returns an instance of a counter singleton, and each time `AddOne()` is invoked on that instance, it increments and returns the next value of the counter.

But the last subtest fails because the value of the counter is 3, not 2!

And the problem is that the previous subtest invokes `AddOne()` once, and value of counter in the next subtest already starts at 1 (not 0).

This is not a problem with the singleton itself, which is supposed to be shared anyway (“Hey, that is what a singleton should do, right?”), but they way tests and subtests work in Go.
The tests and subtests **do not** run like if they were individual programs (like in some other testing libraries in other languages).
In the tests above, `counter`, `ref1` and `ref2` are all the same reference even though they are on their own blocks.
So the `counter` we assigned in the first subtest creates an instance in memory which is shared with the other subtests.

Initially, we could think each test and each subtest should behave like its own, individual program, with its own memory allocation.
But that is not the case.
In reality, all tests of a single package behave like a single, individual program.
And that is so true we can even define a `TestMain` for every individual package.

## stretchr/testify package

<https://github.com/stretchr/testify>

Install or update:

``` go
$ go get github.com/stretchr/testify
```

From now on, we should have both `assert` and `require` available for importing in our test files:

``` go
package mypkg

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)
```

> [!NOTE] Run go mod tidy
> If we simply add the import (without manually installing the package with `go get` first), and then we run `go mod tidy`, the package will get installed and added to `go.mod`.

## Keep getting “run go mod tidy”

Try to run the tests:

```text
$ go test -v .../.
go: updates to go.mod needed; to update it:
	go mod tidy
```

Then run `go mod tidy` _and_ the tests again, just to keep getting the same message that we should run `go mod tidy`.

The problem is the syntax `.../.`, which should be `./...` instead 😅.

```text
$ go test -v ./...
(runs fine now)
```
